# Minor Project for my University senior year

- Made four CNN models with increasing complexity using the sequential API and the functional API from Tensorflow(Keras).

- Manipulated the number of filters and the number of dense layers in all of the models.

- Finally, made an ensemble of all the models which had better accuracy than all the four individual models.

- Tested the model by using random images of skin lesion from google images.
